# ðŸ¤“ Computer Science Trivia Quiz
This web app uses the OpenTriviaDB API to display interactive quiz questions to the user.

## ðŸŽ¬ Behind The Scenes
I wanted to learn more about APIs and so for #100DaysOfCode, I decided to start here with the OpenTrivaDB API because it has great documentation, is beginner friendly,
and does not require authorization.

## ðŸ“š What I have learned about APIs during this project:
* API is really a much larger concept than I originally thought.
* Consuming API data is actually pretty straight forward. You have to know the endpoint and the parameters.
* Displaying API data on the browser is much more time comsuming than just accessing the data.
* I would like to start learning how to create REST APIs
